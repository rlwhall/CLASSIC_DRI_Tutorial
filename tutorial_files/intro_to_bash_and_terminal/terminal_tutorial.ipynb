    "Speaking notes for an Introduction to Bash session with workshop participants. Learners should already be familiar with what the concept of a terminal is. This session will give learners a feel for navigating a computer using the command line, to help conceptualize connecting to a remote machine. Important for students to build intuition for navigating through a computer using the command line.\n",
