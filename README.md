## Project Background

To goal of this project is to improve access to and knowledge of the Digital Research Alliance of Canada’s digital research infrastructure (DRI). This project will develop and deliver approachable tutorials for women in the environmental sciences and showcase a tangible use-case for high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing. These tutorials will demonstrate the setup and operation of CLASSIC-Canada on the DRAC HPC environment. 

The CLASSIC model is an important land surface model in Canada, and is therefore an appealing and engaging example for environmental science researchers and students. This project aims to not only engage women with DRAC’s DRI through topics they are familiar with and interested in, but also provide useful and applicable resources for future environmental science research and researchers. This proposal will expose women to the concepts and possibilities of DRI, increase digital literacy, provide opportunities for role modelling and collaboration, and better understand barriers to DRI access.
