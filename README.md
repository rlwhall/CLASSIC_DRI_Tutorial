# Project Background

To goal of this project is to improve access to and knowledge of the Digital Research Alliance of Canada’s digital research infrastructure
(DRI). This project will develop and deliver approachable tutorials for women in the environmental sciences
and showcase a tangible use-case for high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing. These tutorials
will demonstrate the setup and operation of CLASSIC-Canada on the DRAC HPC environment. 

The CLASSIC
model is an important land surface model in Canada, and is therefore an appealing and engaging example for
environmental science researchers and students. This project aims to not only engage women with DRAC’s DRI
through topics they are familiar with and interested in, but also provide useful and applicable resources for future
environmental science research and researchers. This proposal will expose women to the concepts and possibilities of DRI, increase
digital literacy, provide opportunities for role modelling and collaboration, and better understand barriers to DRI
access.
