## About

This repository contains a tutorial for running the CLASSIC terrestrial biosphere model on the Digital Research Alliance of Canada's Digital Research Infrastructure.

The tutorial in this repository was developed for the project *Empowering Women in Environmental Sciences: Contextual Tutorial for Digital Research Infrastructure*, as a part of the [DRI EDIA Champions Pilot Program](https://alliancecan.ca/en/funding-opportunities/dri-edia-champions-pilot-program). The goal of this project is to improve access to and knowledge of the Digital Research Alliance of Canada’s digital research infrastructure (DRI). This project will develop and deliver approachable tutorials for women in the environmental sciences and showcase a tangible use-case for high-performance computing (HPC) and cloud computing. These tutorials will demonstrate the setup and operation of CLASSIC on the DRAC HPC environment. 

The CLASSIC model is an important land surface model in Canada, and is therefore an appealing and engaging example for environmental science researchers and students. This project aims to not only engage women with DRAC’s DRI through topics they are familiar with and interested in, but also provide useful and applicable resources for future environmental science research and researchers. This proposal will expose women to the concepts and possibilities of DRI, increase digital literacy, provide opportunities for role modelling and collaboration, and better understand barriers to DRI access. 

*Empowering Women in Environmental Sciences: Contextual Tutorial for Digital Research Infrastructure* is supported in part by funding from the Digital Research Alliance of Canada.

## Project Quick Start

#### *CLASSIC*

Usage of this tutorial requires the installation of CLASSIC, an open-source terrestrial biophere model developed and maintained by Environment and Climate Change Canada. To run this totorial the CLASSIC codebase must be installed on the computer running this tutorial. More information on the model can be found on the CLASSIC [website](https://cccma.gitlab.io/classic_pages/), and instructions for how to install and run CLASSIC can be found in the CLASSIC [documentation](https://cccma.gitlab.io/classic/index.html). Running CLASSIC requires obtaining the necessary data files, instructions for which can also be found in the CLASSIC documentation.

#### *Folder Structure*

This tutorial assumes the following folder structure and notation. If folders are structured or denoted differently than what is specified below, the code may not exucute properly.

```
|-- classic_dri_tutorial # Holds the contents of this repository
|-- CLASSIC # Holds the contents of the CLASSIC repository
|-- data # Holds the necessary data files for CLASSIC
|-- output # Will hold the outputs from model runs
```
