## Beginner-Friendly Workshop: Supercomputing for Earth & Environmental Science

Are you interested in learning how to use digital research infrastructure (DRI) and supercomputing for environmental modeling? Join us for an introductory workshop designed for women+ who want to gain hands-on experience in advanced research computing in Earth and Environmental Sciences.

### About the Workshop
This workshop is a part of the [Digital Research Alliance of Canada's](https://alliancecan.ca/en) DRI EDIA Champions program and is open to women and members of other gender equity-seeking groups (women+). No prior experience is required! Participants will gain foundational knowledge about digital research infrastructure and supercomputing, and learn how to run CLASSIC—an advanced terrestrial biosphere model developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada.

CLASSIC is a powerful computer model which can simulate the complex interactions within land-based ecosystems, including plant growth and carbon cycling. It helps researchers understand and predict how terrestrial ecosystems respond to climate change and land use shifts, making it a vital tool in earth system science.

#### What You’ll Learn:

- Introduction to digital research infrastructure and supercomputing
- Introduction to development tools such as the terminal, JupyterLab, bash and python
- How to run an environmental model (CLASSIC) and interpret model simulations

#### Who Should Attend?
This workshop is ideal for women+ interested in earth and environmental sciences, whether you're a student, researcher, or professional looking to explore supercomputing for environmental modeling. No technical background is necessary—just a curiosity to learn!

#### Additional Details:

- Free to attend
- Food and beverages will be provided
- Exclusive to women+ and gender equity-seeking groups
- No previous experience required
- Workshop will take place from 4:00pm-7:00pm on March 6, 2025
